Building a Signed APK or App Bundle
To build a signed APK or App Bundle with minimal compressed size, follow these steps in Android Studio (2023 Koala or later):

Open Project:

Unzip AbhayattccDictionaryReader.zip into a directory.
Open the project in Android Studio by selecting the AbhayattccDictionaryReader folder.


Update Placeholders:

In 40_AndroidManifest.xml, replace YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID with your AdMob App ID.

In 05_BillingManager.kt, replace premium_subscription with your Play Console product ID.
In 39_privacy_policy.html, update support@abhayattcc.com with your contact email.


Optimize for Size:

Enable Minification: 42_build.gradle.kts already enables isMinifyEnabled = true and isShrinkResources = true for the release build.
Optimize Databases: Run sqlite3 <db_file> "VACUUM;" on each .db file to compact them.


Optimize Images: Ensure ic_app_icon.png and ic_splash_background.png are compressed (e.g., WebP format).
Add ABI Splits: To further reduce APK size, add to 42_build.gradle.kts:
kotlinandroid {
    splits {
        abi {
            isEnable = true
            reset()
            include("armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86", "x86_64")
            isUniversalApk = false
        }
    }
}



Generate Signing Key:

In Android Studio, go to Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK.
Select APK or Android App Bundle and click Create new....
Fill in:

Key store path: path/to/your.keystore (e.g., ~/myapp.keystore).
Key store password, key alias, and key password.
Certificate details (optional).


Save the .keystore file securely.




Build Signed APK:

Go to Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK.
Select APK, choose your .keystore, and enter credentials.
Select release build variant.
Choose V1 (JAR Signature) and V2 (Full APK Signature).
Output: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk (expected size: ~10-20 MB).



Build Signed App Bundle:

Select Android App Bundle in Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK.
Use the same .keystore and credentials.
Output: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab (expected size: ~8-15 MB).
